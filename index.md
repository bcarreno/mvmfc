I had read Bill Warner’s book and taught my children (8 and 10) how to build the Sky Bunny, they were very excited flying their creations. That’s when I heard about the contest, I thought it was a good opportunity to take the next step and put them to compete.

We belong to the Martha’s Vineyard Model Flying Club, and after circulating an invitation, we had five people committed: two in the Old Fart category, my two kids in Junior and myself in Open.

My friend Carl ordered the pins and gave them to the participants, this was a big factor encouraging the kids, they were excited and wore them every time we went to the flying field.

Carl had an old Sky Bunny he built a long time ago but he knew he could get better performance building a new one, so he ordered the kit from Peck Polymers. Unfortunately Carl’s plane got damaged the day before the event and could not participate.

My other friend, Jack, ordered the kit but was not able to finish construction on time.

For my kids and I it was our first time competing and after learning we should aim for more than 1 minute, we started improving our models. Right thrust on both of my children’s planes was too sharp and they had to replace the nose tubes. In my plane the axle got bent and I had to replace it as well. We also tried different rubber configurations for the motor.

But moving the wing and working on the balance was the factor that had the highest impact on performance. When I got 91 second and almost lost the plane in the woods I felt I was ready for the competition. My children were getting between 30 and 46 seconds.

I flew Sunday the 6th as early as I could and my best time was 97 seconds, which is what I posted. My kids were not in the mood to go early and decided to wait, which was not a good idea because the wind picked up and there was not another chance to fly after that.

We live on an island, not many people fly models here, and if we want to participate in an event it is always a long drive. This contest was a good motivation to hone our skills, it was also a great way to have fun with my kids.

## We also fly outdoors in the summer
