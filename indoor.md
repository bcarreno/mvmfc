### The Rules

Everybody must wear non-marking sole shoes and wipe them at the door.

Anyone not flying with a 2.4GHz radio or who is new to flying should check in with the Safety Officer prior to operating their aircraft on site.

Defined flying area will be inside the purple out-of-bounds lines of the basketball court.  The flight line will be outside the SE of the flying area.

R/C pilots must be standing at the flight line while flying. Free flight pilots are not bound by this restriction.

The pit area will be behind the flight line.  Spectators must be in the bleachers area.

The Safety Officer is responsible for safety, timing the flights, and insuring that spectators remain in their designated area.

At no time should spectators be in the active flying area. Flyers may only retrieve their models after clearing it with any other active flyers.

Pilots binding their 2.4GHz equipment must move at least 30’ away from any other plane or radio.

Maximum number of planes/helicopters in the air at one time will be determined by flyers on the scene.

Flying in a manner that could endanger other pilots or spectators may result in a meeting with the Safety Officer to discuss safety concerns.

Aircraft size: Helicopters should not be larger than the Blade 130X (5 oz. with battery and rotor of 13”) Multirotors must measure 15” or less diagonally from tip to tip. Airplanes should not have a wingspan greater than 34” or weight more than 250 grams (9 ozs.) MVMFC reserves the right to inspect and judge the suitability of any plane or helicopter for indoor use. Speed and weight will be the main criteria to avoid dangerous situations.
