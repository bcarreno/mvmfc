The Marthaâ€™s Vineyard Model Flying Club (MVMFC) is a non-profit Island
organization founded in 2004 with the purpose of furthering the hobby of model
aircraft building and flying on the Island.

We are a charter member of the [Academy of Model Aeronautics](http://www.modelaircraft.org/),
the national organization devoted to our hobby.

A primary goal for our club is getting young people on the Island involved
with building and flying model aircraft. To that end, we have for several years been
able to have our young members fly and receive instruction in the high school gym
Saturday mornings during the fall and winter.

We have also developed an outdoor
flying field with both grass and artificial turf for student instruction, as well as
general flying, whenever the weather permits.

In 2012 the MVMFC initiated a model aviation build/fly program at the
Edgartown School, one day a week for four weeks in the fall.
