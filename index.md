We are an organization founded in 2004 with the purpose of furthering the hobby of model
aircraft building and flying on the Island.

We are a charter member of the [Academy of Model Aeronautics](http://www.modelaircraft.org/),
the national organization devoted to our hobby.

One of our main goals is getting young people on the Island involved
with building and flying model aircraft.

Since 2007 we have been flying in the high school gym Saturday mornings during the fall and winter.

In 2012 we initiated a model aviation build/fly program at the
Edgartown School, one day a week for four weeks in the fall.

## Outdoor Flying

We have also developed an outdoor
flying field with both grass and artificial turf for student instruction, as well as
general flying, whenever the weather permits.
